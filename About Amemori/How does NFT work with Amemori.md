# How does NFT work with Amemori

We've simplified the process of transforming your art into NFT directly from the Amemori app.

**1、Create an artwork using Enhance+ or AI Filter.**

Our most advanced AI-powered photo tool will help you create a stunning artwork.

**2、 Publish your artwork & mint NFT for free.**

Your art will be minted for free and green on Polygon, a layer 2 solution built on top of Ethereum.

If you want to mint to your own wallet, then provide your own wallet address (e.g. copy-paste from MetaMask).

**3、Viewing, trading and selling your NFTs on OpenSea**

When you minted NFTs for your artwork, they're automatically listed on Opensea. You can also see, sell or trade the NFT on OpenSea under your account (if you minted to your own wallet) or at Amemori collection. It usually takes a few minutes for OpenSea to update its database.
